Spreadsheet SupplementaryTable1.csv:

1. Description: Isotopic data used to create a local meteoric water line in GNP. Data presented was gathered from published USGS data on the NWIS website. Sites were selected based on proximity to GNP. Isotopic values can greatly change based on physical location, so it was important to only include sites which were located in GNP and in close proximity to the sampling sites used in this study (U.S. Geological Survey, 2016).
